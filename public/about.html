<h1 style="color: red;">About DeadPool</h1>
Deadpool is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld, the character first appeared in New Mutants #98 (December 1990). In his comic book appearances, Deadpool is initially depicted as a supervillain of the New Mutants and X-Force, though later stories would portray him as an antihero. Deadpool is the alter ego of Wade Wilson, a disfigured Canadian mercenary with superhuman regenerative healing abilities. He is known for his tendency to joke incessantly and break the fourth wall for humorous effect.

<p>The character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media. 
  In the 2004 series Cable & Deadpool, he refers to his own scarred appearance as "Ryan Renolds [sic] crossed with a Shar-Pei".
</p>
  <p>[6][7] Reynolds himself would eventually portray the character in the X-Men film series, appearing 
    in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), Deadpool (2016), and its sequel Deadpool 2 (2018).

      Reynolds attributes Cable & Deadpool #2 to what got him invested in the character and inspired him to bring the character to the movies.[11] 
      He will continue playing the character in Deadpool 3 (2024), set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

    <h2 style="color: red;">Powers and abilities</h2>
      <p>Deadpool's primary power is an accelerated healing factor, depicted by various writers at differing levels of efficiency. 
      The speed of his healing factor depends on the severity of the wound and Deadpool's mental state. It works most efficiently when he is awake, 
      alert, and in good spirits.[76] Deadpool's accelerated healing factor is strong enough that he has survived complete incineration and 
      decapitation more than once. Although his head normally has to be reunited with his body to heal a decapitation wound,
      he was able to regrow his head after having it pulverized by the Hulk in the graphic novel Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe.

      Deadpool's brain cells are similarly affected, with dying neurons being rejuvenated at a super accelerated rate. 
      This allows Deadpool to recover from any head wounds, and it renders him nearly invulnerable to psychic and telepathic powers,
      [80][81] although this ability is inconsistent.[82][83] It has been revealed that at the time his healing ability was given to him,
       Deadpool suffered from some form of cancer; after the healing factor was given to him, it made his normal cells as well as his
        cancerous cells unable to die, giving him a heavily scarred appearance beneath his suit.[volume & issue needed]

Deadpool's body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins, due to his accelerated healing factor. For example, it is extremely difficult
 for him to become intoxicated.[84] He can be affected by certain drugs, such as tranquilizers if he is exposed to a large enough dosage.
 [citation needed] Unlike Wolverine, whose wounds sometimes cause excruciating pain as they heal depending on the severity,
  Deadpool has some degree of pain insensitivity.[8
